This is the source code for my personal website: [https://juhawilppu.fi](https://juhawilppu.fi)

The site is intentionally minimal — just HTML and CSS — and acts as a landing page for my professional profile, CV, and selected projects.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Plain HTML + CSS
- Deployed via `rsync` using a small shell script
- Hosted on a personal Linux server
